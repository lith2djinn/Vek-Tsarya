#LEADER DESCRITIONS AND BOOKMARKS# 
RUSSIAN_EMPIRE_DESC:0 "The Russian Empire became one of the victorious powers in the Velikaya Voyna. A new emperor Alexei II and the State Duma carried out social reforms that pacified people. By the end of the 1920s the russian economy had finally recovered from the aftermath of the war and its growth began. Influence of russian culture also reached new heights. The new golden age soon began to be associated with Alexei II so came the term "Zolotoy Vek Tsarya Alekseya" (Golden Age of Tsar Alexei) or just Vek Tsarya (Age of the Tsar). But Russia still has many internal problems, and the emperor is sick with hemophilia so who knows how long he and his golden age will last..."
