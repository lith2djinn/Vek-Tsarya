legacyofthe1934uprising:0 "Legacy of the 1934 Uprising"
legacyofthe1934uprising_desc:0 "In 1934, the Revolutionary Nationalists led by de La Rocque and other conservative groups, aided by Conservative army generals such as Petain, overthrew the decadent and failed Third Republic. Let us now look forward to the future of France. "
amotorizedforce:0 "A Motorized Force"
amotorizedforce_desc:0 "One of the major lessons of the Great War was that mobility is key- at the Marne, we used cars to stop the German advance. If we can mechanize our entire army, it would be of great advantage."
embracemechanization:0 "Embrace Mechanization"
embracemechanization_desc:0 "To avoid the horrific casualties that methodical artillery based combat, we must embrace mechanization to break through enemy lines and achieve victory."
refineddoctrine:0 "Refined Doctrine"
refineddoctrine_desc:0 "Through carefully planned coordination and planning we can refine the doctrine of overwhelming the enemy with firepower."
pourlafrance:0 "Pour la France!"
pourlafrance_desc:0 "The wretched Germans defeated us in 1916 when we gave up after the loss of Verdun. We have defeated those within France itself that wanted to see the nation crumble, and now we will avenge the Great War! En l'avant!"
anewfrencharmy:0 "A New French Army"
anewfrencharmy_desc:0 "Our forces were shattered by the Germans in the Great War and eventually mutinied after our attacks failed suicidally. We must re-think our approach for the next war. "
experimentwiththetank:0 "Experiment with the Tank"
experimentwiththetank_desc:0 "In our last great offensive during the Great War before the mutinies, the British used what was then an experimental technology- the tank. Since our defeat came soon after and thus the war in the west. We should re-visit this technology."
refinetheartillery:0 "Refine the Artillery"
refinetheartillery_desc:0 "We learned the horrors and benefits of artillery fire in the Great War. We must ensure our artillery response system is quick and well organized."
infantrysupport:0 "Infantry Support"
infantrysupport_desc:0 "We must arm our troops with top-notch support weaponry to ensure they are prepared for infantry fighting."
formalizethenewstate:0 "Formalize the new state"
formalizethenewstate_desc:0 "After two years of joint military rule between the military and the Provisional Government, we must formalize the rule of the new France. The current broad coalition is a loose association of monarchists, nationalists, and other conservatives. "
onepartyrule:0 "One Party Rule"
onepartyrule_desc:0 "The French Revolutionary Nationalist Party, RNPF, took the most active role in the 1934 uprising, comprising mainly of nationalists and disgruntled veterans of the Great War. Let us formalize their one party rule and proclaim François de La Rocque as the Chief of the French State."
militaryrule:0 "Military Rule"
militaryrule_desc:0 "The French Military, led by Phillipe Petain, was the instrument for the 1934 revolution. As we look towards foreign threats on all sides, it makes sense for us to continue total military rule."
afrenchmonarchy:0 "A French Monarchy"
afrenchmonarchy_desc:0 "The best compromise between the Nationalist coalition is a coronation of a new French Monarch. But this erupts another debate- a Bonaparte or Bourbon?"
